# relplay-server
RelPlay is a graph-based web music player and music library organizer. It lets you customize relationships between entities (tracks, albums, artists, genres, labels, ...) in a way you find the most useful. Using this data, RelPlay generates interactive graph visualisations that help make sense of your large music library and make navigation easier than scrolling through long lists. Another useful feature is automatic playlist generation based on the graph structure.

This repo contains the server part of the application, you can read more about the project and the server in the docs.
